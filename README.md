# Edge Fleet Hub

Edge Fleet Hub is a local-first simulator for managing edge devices without requiring physical hardware or an external broker. The service provides device registration, heartbeat updates, live telemetry ingestion, fleet snapshots, telemetry history with bounded pagination, and offline batch replay with per-device deduplication. It is intended to grow into a complete device operations platform with rules and alerts, configuration delivery, messaging, and auditable remote maintenance.

All state is held in local memory by default: no hardware, database, or external service is required.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/edge-fleet
```

The service listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Override it with `EDGE_FLEET_ADDR`.

### Optional local persistence

Set `EDGE_FLEET_DATA_DIR` to a directory for durable storage; leave it unset to
keep the original in-memory behaviour. The listening configuration, HTTP
endpoints and response formats are unchanged.

```bash
EDGE_FLEET_DATA_DIR=./fleet-data go run ./cmd/edge-fleet
```

- The directory is created if missing; an empty directory simply starts fresh.
- If the directory cannot be created, read or written, startup fails with an
  explanatory error — the service never silently falls back to memory mode.
- All successful writes are flushed to a local write-ahead log before the
  response is returned. Each write request is one commit unit, in particular a
  replay batch (its samples, sequences, device state and receipt commit or
  roll back together). If a write cannot be persisted at runtime the request
  fails with `503`: no sequence is consumed, no receipt is kept and previously
  queryable state is untouched; the same request can be retried once storage is
  healthy again.
- After a normal exit, a crash or a forced kill, reopening the same directory
  restores devices, registration and last-active times, last telemetry, the
  complete histories with their receive sequences, per-device event
  deduplication records and batch receipts. Recovery never refreshes device
  timestamps; new samples continue the previous sequence. Re-submitting a
  batch that had already succeeded returns the first receipt (`200`); changing
  its content still returns `409`.
- History continuation tokens issued before a restart remain valid afterwards
  and keep their pinned sequence high-water mark. Using a cursor against a
  different data directory (even one with the same device ids) returns `400`;
  unknown devices still return `404`.
- Only one server process may open a given data directory at a time; a second
  process fails before accepting requests and never modifies existing data.
  The lock is released automatically on exit or kill — no manual cleanup is
  needed before restarting.
- If committed data is corrupt, uses an unsupported format, or contains
  inconsistent records, startup fails with an explanatory error and leaves the
  files untouched rather than discarding records.
- Persistence depends only on local files; no database or external service is
  involved.

The data directory holds three files: `wal.log` (checksummed record log),
`commit.log` (fixed-width commit journal marking which WAL bytes are
acknowledged) and `lock` (the inter-process lock). They are managed entirely by
the server; copying a directory offline while no process holds it is a valid
backup, but the files should not be hand-edited.

Register a device and send live telemetry:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/devices \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id":"gateway-01","site":"warehouse-a"}'

curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/devices/gateway-01/telemetry \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"temperature":23.5,"battery":91}'

curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/fleet
```

## Offline batch replay

`POST /v1/devices/{id}/replay` submits a batch of samples captured offline.
Each sample needs a unique `eventId`, an RFC3339 `observedAt`, and a non-empty
`values` map of finite numbers; a batch holds 1–100 samples. Both `eventId`
and `batchId` are deduplicated **within the device**:

- A new batch returns `202 Accepted`. The receipt lists each sample's assigned
  receive sequence plus `newCount`/`duplicateCount`.
- An `eventId` already known to the device with the same UTC instant and the
  same key/value pairs is a duplicate: it reuses the original sequence and is
  not stored again. Different time or values for the same `eventId` conflicts
  the whole batch (`409`).
- Re-submitting the same `batchId` with identical ordered content returns `200
  OK` and the first receipt. Changed content returns `409`.
- Conflicts and validation errors roll the whole batch back: no samples,
  sequences, or receipts remain, and device state (last active time / last
  telemetry) is not refreshed by duplicates or failures.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/devices/gateway-01/replay \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "batchId": "offline-dump-2024-01-02",
        "samples": [
          {"eventId":"evt-1","observedAt":"2024-01-02T10:00:00Z","values":{"temperature":21.0}},
          {"eventId":"evt-2","observedAt":"2024-01-02T10:05:00Z","values":{"temperature":21.4,"battery":90}}
        ]
      }'
# 202 -> {"batchId":"...","newCount":2,"duplicateCount":0,
#         "samples":[{"eventId":"evt-1","sequence":2,"duplicate":false}, ...]}
```

Duplicate detection compares times as UTC instants (`2024-01-02T18:00:00+08:00`
equals `2024-01-02T10:00:00Z`) and values by key/value.

## Telemetry history

Live telemetry and accepted replay samples all enter the device history.
Per-device receive sequences start at 1 and increase contiguously; live
telemetry is timestamped at server receive time.

`GET /v1/devices/{id}/history` returns events in ascending receive sequence and
supports:

- `from` / `to`: RFC3339 observed-time bounds, both inclusive.
- `limit`: 1–100 matching events per page (default 20).
- `cursor`: opaque continuation token from the previous page; `nextCursor` is
  `null` on the last page.

```bash
curl -sS 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/devices/gateway-01/history?from=2024-01-02T00:00:00Z&to=2024-01-03T00:00:00Z&limit=50'

# follow nextCursor
curl -sS 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/devices/gateway-01/history?limit=50&cursor=<nextCursor>'
```

The first page pins the maximum sequence visible at that moment; later pages
only read within that bound, so writes arriving while paging can neither skip
nor duplicate rows (start a fresh first page to see newer data). A cursor is
only valid for its device and filter — reusing it on another device, with a
different filter, or after tampering returns `400`; an unknown device returns
`404`.

## Persistence and restart

Without `EDGE_FLEET_DATA_DIR`, everything (devices, events, sequences, batch
receipts) lives in process memory and **restarting the process clears all
data**; sequence counters restart from 1 for each freshly registered device.

With `EDGE_FLEET_DATA_DIR` set, the same state survives process restarts via
the local write-ahead log described under [Optional local
persistence](#optional-local-persistence) above.

## Test

go test ./...
